Welcome to our exploration into global coffee bean sales, conducted with a focus on statistical analysis using R AND Python. Our project dives deep into a comprehensive examination of coffee consumption across 4500 regions worldwide. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides a rich source of information for our analysis. While the exact data points are not critical for our learning goals, we aim to gain proficiency in R and R Studio and extract valuable insights from large datasets.

Our journey commences with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the coffee consumption dataset, where we uncover various patterns and insights. 

Moving forward, we proceed to calculate the Coffee Consumption Index (CCI), allowing for a comprehensive comparison among diverse regions. Refer to the `With_Coffe.R` file for a detailed breakdown of our CCI analysis.

Next, we investigate how coffee consumption varies globally to identify the factors influencing regional coffee buying behaviours. Additionally, we evaluate basic pricing and sales figures by country and major city to assess the affordability and demand for coffee. The `Coffee_Chain_Sales.csv` file contains all the detailed findings.

In our concluding phase, we delve into an insightful comparison between regions based on their development status to understand how coffee consumption trends differ between countries. Refer to the `Coffee_Chain_Sales.csv` file for this analysis.

Join us as we navigate the nuances of statistical analysis and unveil meaningful insights into global coffee consumption trends.
